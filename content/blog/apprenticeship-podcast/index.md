### Apprenticeship Program Podcast

A podcast were we talked about the apprenticeship program for the company I work with, If you're looking to join Codurance I'll recommend you to hear the experiences of previous apprentices and talk about the program, the good and bad, and the recommendations on how to travers through it.
